## 🏭 Inside the "Money Factory" (The 9 Steps)

We don't guess. We analyze. Here is how we cook the data:


**1. The Source (Data Source)**

We grab data from everywhere. MT5, CSVs, Databases. We even mix them! Want to see if Gold moves Bitcoin? We can do that.

![Data Source Selection](./Images/Screenshot%20from%202025-11-30%2017-26-33.png)

<!-- slide -->

**2. The Tech (Technical Analysis)**

We calculate over 50 indicators. RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands... the works. But we also check the *diffs* (changes). That's the secret sauce.

<!-- slide -->

**3. The Zones (SNR Analysis)**

Where will the price bounce? We find the "floors" (Support) and "ceilings" (Resistance). We know where the price is likely to turn.

**4. The Stars (Astronomical)**

Yes, really! Moon phases, planets... sometimes the market moves with the stars. We track it all.

<!-- slide -->

**5. The Vibe (News Sentiment)**

What is Twitter saying? What is the news saying? We read it all to know if the market is happy or scared.

<!-- slide -->

**6. The Check (Feature Review)**

Quality control. We make sure the data is clean before the AI touches it.

<!-- slide -->

**7. The Prep (ML Preparation)**

We organize the data into neat little packages for the AI brain to learn from.

<!-- slide -->

**8. The Brain (Model Selection)**

This is where you build your AI. LSTM, CNN, Transformers... pick your fighter!
