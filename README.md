## 🚀 Beyond a Trading Tool: The FinDash Buddy Ecosystem

FinDash Buddy is a powerful, standalone AI-powered trading laboratory, it is also the gateway to a revolutionary financial ecosystem powered by the **BESHA** utility token. This project's vision extends far beyond charts and models to create a community-owned, decentralized economy.

**BESHA ("PESA" in Swahili)** is founded on three core principles:

1.  **Reputation-First Economy**: Your on-chain reputation matters more than your wallet size. Good actors are rewarded, while bad actors are publicly and permanently flagged.
2.  **Real Utility from Day One**: BESHA isn't a speculative asset; it's the required currency for AI model access, data contributions, peer-to-peer commerce, and earning rewards.
3.  **Community Ownership**: The ecosystem is designed to share 70% of platform revenues back to the token holders, contributors, and operators who create its value.

This ecosystem is comprised of two main applications:
*   **FinDash Buddy**: The AI trading laboratory detailed in this README.
*   **Dumo**: A social finance "Chat-app" for messenger/whatsapp  type messaging and peer-to-peer commerce, group savings, and more.

## 👋 Hey! I'm Daniel — And This Is the Tool I Built for Myself (and Now for You)

I have spent over 10 years learning and researching for Machine learning and finance, I was that guy drowning in notebooks, CSVs, and half-baked models. One notebook for Gold, another for BTC, another for NAS100… same code, just copy-paste. I created and trained accurate models that I lost track of. Every model demanded its own environment and my laptop looked like a data crime scene.

I believe in **data for evidence** with repeatable experiments/measurements,  this drove the need to have anenvironment where I would create , train and deploy this models.  

**"And here we are!"**

So I stopped jumping between scattered pipelines and built one unified system — a real lab where my technical analysis, astro cycles, volatility studies, ML models, and RL agents could live together.

That lab became **FinDash Buddy**.

![Main Dashboard - Live Trading View](./Images/Screenshot%20from%202025-11-30%2017-25-11.png)
*My command center. Live charts, smart metrics, my watchlist — everything I used to jump between in 10 tabs now lives in one place.*

## 🎯 Why I'm Building FinDash Buddy

Trading is about being sure of your **next step** or making decisions based on an optimal patth for your goal; in this case Making profits consistently. For me, building FinDash Buddy was about moving from guesswork to **evidence-based confidence**. I wanted a system where data doesn't just sit in the background—it actually backs up every reason for entering a trade.

Through years of backtesting, I’ve learned a critical lesson: most market situations are explainable with data. When you have that data, you can formulate hypotheses that either stand or fall. I didn't just want a "black box" model; I wanted to understand the *reasoning* behind a signal—whether it's from a technical system or a deep learning model.

The reasons for building this are endless, but here are the ones that kept me up at night:

*   **Breaking the Cycle**: I was tired of training an LSTM on Gold, only to have to start from zero for EURUSD. I needed a factory that could scale experiments efficiently.
*   **Democratizing Power**: Make Findash available to all users?
*   **From Lab to Live**: I've seen brilliant open-source models (some of which I built) sit idle because there was no easy way to plug them into a real trading environment.
*   **Focus over Chaos**: I was switching between 15 different apps just to understand a single market move. I needed one "Command Center."

So I asked myself:
**"What if I gave every trader — coder or not — the same firepower I designed for myself?"**

That question became the soul of FinDash Buddy.

## 🎯 So What is Findash ?

FinDash Buddy is your advanced **AI-Powered Trading Laboratory**, designed to bridge the gap between complex quantitative analysis and everyday trading. Findaah app comes as an installable and is designed for offline first, meaning you can interract with your agents and models even without internet. However since Findash is built on web3 and depends on blockchain  online access is mandaory after a while to sync blockchain security, whilst ensuring you can sill make transactions while offline.  Findash is a unified ecosystem where you can create, explore and discover, analyze, and automate your trading strategies using state-of-the-art AI.

### 📊 Intelligent Dashboard Metrics
The dashboard doesn't just show you numbers; it gives you **context**. Behind every symbol, Findash calculates real-time "Smart Metrics":
- **Price & Change**: Real-time tracking of market value and movement.
- **Volatility**: Measures the average price range as a percentage, helping you gauge risk instantly.
- **Speed**: The velocity of price movement—identifying when the market is "accelerating."
- **Direction**: A clear "Bullish" or "Bearish" designation based on momentum and trend analysis.
- **Regime**: Tells you if the market is currently **Stable** or **Volatile**, allowing you to adjust your strategy accordingly.
- **Multi-Timeframe Alignment**: See all the above across M1, M5, H1, H4, and D1 simultaneously to ensure your trade has "consensus" across the board.

### 🤖 The Agentic Framework: Hire Your AI Staff
In Findash, you don't just watch the market—you **hire agents** to do it for you. 
- **Easy Creation**: Use the **Create Agent** to "hire" an agent for any asset. 
- **Customize your Agent**: Give your agent ML models for context
- **Custom Instructions**: Give your agent a "Mission"—e.g., *"Notify me when RSI is oversold on 15m but the daily trend is bullish."*
- **Bounded Autonomy**: Your agents operate 24/7 within the parameters you set, monitoring live streams and executing their "Mission" instructions autonomously.
- **Deployment**: Once "hired," your agents live in the **Side Panel**, constantly scanning, thinking, and ready to alert you or take action.

### 🛠️ Agentic Toolbelt
Your agents aren't just reading text; they have access to powerful tools to make better decisions:
- **🌐 Web Search**: Agents can search the live internet for breaking news and real-time market sentiment.
- **📚 RAG Knowledge Base**: Access to a massive financial database for deep historical context.
- **🔍 SQL Querying**: Secure, direct access to the trading database to verify patterns.
- **🧠 Model Inference**: The ability to run your own **Trained ML Models** to predict future price action.

### 🏭 The "Money Factory" Training Pipeline
Findash includes a professional-grade **Analysis Pipeline** that takes you from raw data to a deployed AI agent:
1. **Data Source**: Load MT5 or CSV data.
2. **Technical & SNR**: Auto-calculate 50+ indicators and Support/Resistance zones.
3. **Cosmic & Sentiment**: Add Astronomical cycles and News sentiment into the mix.
4. **Feature Review**: Use advanced statistics to keep only the features that actually work.
5. **ML Preparation**: Build "ML-ready" sequences for neural networks.
6. **Model Selection**: Choose from **LSTM, TCN, Transformers**, or **CNN** architectures.
7. **Model Training** : Now train your model  with the training / test data we just created in the ml step
8. **Deployment**: Once trained, your model can be "plugged in" to your AI Agents for live execution.

### ✨ Why Findash Wins (Our Strengths)
- **Unified Lab**: No more jumping between 10 apps. Charts, Indicators, ML Training, and AI Agents all live in one house.
- **No-Code AI**: You can build and train some of the world's most advanced Deep Learning models without writing a single line of code.
- **Evidence-Based Trading**: Stop guessing. Every decision is backed by the 9-step factory and measurable data.
- **Proactive Intelligence**: Your agents don't wait for you to open the app; they are working for you while you sleep.


### 🧠 AI & LLM Architecture: Local-First Intelligence

Findash is built on a **Local-First** AI philosophy. While we support major cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini), the heart of the platform is the **Ollama Integration**.
- **Privacy & Speed**: By running models locally (like Llama 3.1 or Phi-3), your trading data never leaves your machine, and inference happen with zero network latency.
- **Provider Pattern**: The `AIManager` backend uses a modular provider pattern, allowing you to hot-swap between local Ollama instances and cloud APIs without changing your agent's instructions.

It is with this architecure that I will introduce my own llm that I had been working on a while, but for stability I have designed the system around the Ollama architecture. Transformers js proved tto be more memory intensive and so I shifted from it.

### 🛠️ Setting Up Your AI Council

Findash allows you to create a personalized "Board of Directors" for your trading. Here is how you configure your agents:

1.  **Open the Council**: Click the AI Chat button to open the `MultiAIChatWindow`.
2.  **Add Participant**: Click the "+" button to open the `AIParticipantSelector`.
3.  **Choose a Template or Go Custom**:
    *   **Templates**: Select pre-tuned experts like "Bull Analyst" (optimistic pattern seeker), "Risk Manager" (conservative), or "Technical Purist".
    *   **Custom**: Define your own agent. Give it a name, an avatar, and a specific "System Prompt" (Mission).
4.  **Select the Brain**: Choose the underlying model. You can assign a lightweight local model (e.g., `Phi-3`) for quick queries and a heavy cloud model (e.g., `GPT-4-Turbo`) for complex reasoning.

### 🔄 The Life of a Request: From Prompt to Profit

How does the magic happen? Let's trace a request like:
*"Run a correlation analysis for EURUSD and Gold, then send me a report."*

1.  **Context Assembly (The "Input")**:
    *   The **Frontend** grabs the current state: Price of EURUSD, Gold, current indicators (RSI=70, MACD=Bullish), and recent news headlines.
    *   It packages this into a "Context Block" invisible to you but vital for the AI.

2.  **Orchestration (The "Decision")**:
    *   The `MultiAIChatContext` analyzes your request. It sees you need data comparison.
    *   If you addressed a specific agent (e.g., `@Quant`), it routes strictly to them. If not, the "Orchestrator" decides who is best suited (e.g., the Data Analyst agent).

3.  **Tool Execution (The "Action")**:
    *   The agent realizes it needs historical correlation data. It triggers the `execute_analysis` tool.
    *   **Backend**: The `tool_router` receives this, runs a Python script to calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient over the last 90 days, and returns the result (e.g., `0.85 positive correlation`).

4.  **Synthesis & Response**:
    *   The agent receives this number. It doesn't just print it; it *interprets* it:
    *   *"EURUSD and Gold are maintaining a strong 0.85 correlation. Given Gold's recent breakout, EURUSD is statistically likely to follow upwards."*

5.  **Future Actions (The "Enhancement")**:
    *   *Coming Soon*: The agent triggers the `email_service` tool to format this insight into a PDF and email it to you automatically.

### 💬 Example Prompts & Agent Responses

Here is how different agents interpret the same market data:

**Scenario**: EURUSD is approaching a major resistance level at 1.1000.

#### 1. The "Bull Analyst" (`@Bull`)
> **User**: "What's the play here?"
> **Response**: "I'm seeing a classic **Cup and Handle** forming on the H4 timeframe! Volume is rising on the approach to 1.1000. If we break this resistance, we have wide open skies until 1.1050. I recommend looking for buy stops above the breakout!"

#### 2. The "Risk Manager" (`@Risk`)
> **User**: "What's the play here?"
> **Response**: "Caution is advised. We are at a historic rejection point (1.1000). RSI is also overbought at 75. Even if you are bullish, waiting for a confirmed retest of 1.1000 turns resistance into support. Don't chase the green candles; wait for the setup."

#### 3. The "Sentiment Scout" (`@Sentiment`)
> **User**: "What is the market feeling?"
> **Response**: "I've scanned recent news and Twitter sentiment. There is a lot of chatter about the upcoming ECB announcement. The 'Fear & Greed Index' is at 65 (Greed), suggesting the crowd is getting euphoric. Be careful of a 'buy the rumor, sell the news' event."

### 🚀 Advanced Capabilities: The Autonomous Hedge Fund (Beta)

The system has evolved from a simple chatbot to a semi-autonomous trading backend.

#### 1. Autonomous Agent Loops (`AgentRunner`)
Your agents don't just chat; they work.
*   **Bounded Autonomy**: You can assign an agent to "Watch" a specific asset (e.g., BTCUSD).
*   **The Loop**: Every hour (or your set interval), the agent:
    1.  Wakes up.
    2.  Reads the latest 10 candles and technical indicators.
    3.  Consults its "Mission" (e.g., "Find RSI divergence").
    4.  **Decides**: Outputs a structured decision: `WAIT`, `BUY`, `SELL`, or `NOTIFY`.
    5.  **Acts**: Updates your dashboard or sends an alert.

#### 2. The "Cosmic" Data Layer
Findash now correlates financial data with non-traditional datasets to find hidden edges:
*   **☀️ Space Weather**: Ingests Solar Wind and Kp Index data from NOAA. (Research suggests geomagnetic storms correlate with market volatility).
*   **🌍 Seismic Activity**: Tracks global earthquakes via USGS to predict regional economic disruptions.
*   **🐍 Python Sandbox**: A secure environment to write and test your *own* Python indicators against live market data without crashing the server.

### 🔮 Future Enhancements
*   **Collaborative Swarms**: Multiple agents debating a trade live in your chat window—The Technical Analyst arguing with the Fundamental Analyst—giving you a balanced perspective before you click 'Buy'.
*   **Direct Broker Execution**: Allowing agents to not just signal 'BUY', but execute it via bridge API (User approval required). 

### 🌉 The MT5 Bridge: Decentralized Data Gateway
To ensure Findash is accessible and robust, I built a custom **MT5-Bridge**. This is a high-performance Wine-based wrapper that exposes the MetaTrader 5 terminal as a clean, modern Flask API.
- **Why MetaTrader 5?**: 
    - **Total Accessibility**: MT5 is free and available to any trader with a brokerage account worldwide.
    - **Decentralization by Design**: Since MT5 supports thousands of brokers, Findash is not tied to a single liquidity provider. If one broker goes down, you simply switch your bridge to another—one failure won't affect the entire platform.
    - **Reliability**: We wrap the native MQL5 environment in a Pythonic API, allowing for stable, "hands-off" data streaming and trade execution.

### 💻 Python & JavaScript to MQL5: Bridging the Gap
One of the biggest hurdles in trading is the "MQL5 tax"—the requirement to learn a specific, C++ like language just to test a simple idea. Findash solves this by bridging the worlds of Web and Data Science:
- **Unified Logic**: Through the **Code Window**, you can write your trading logic in **Python or JavaScript**. 
- **The MQL5 "Bypass"**: You get the power of MQL5's market access without ever having to touch a `.mq5` file. Your Python/JS code interacts with the bridge to execute trades, calculate custom indicators, and run ML inferences with ease.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Go from a data science experiment in a notebook to a live-running strategy in minutes.


## 🏭 The 9-Step "Money Factory" - Deep Dive

## 🛠️ Building Your Own Models - The Creator's Guide

**Can I code my own model?** YES! Here's how:

### **Option 1: Use the Model Builder (No Code)**
1. Go to Step 8 (Model Selection)
2. Browse the model catalog
3. Select an architecture (LSTM, TCN, Transformer, etc.)
4. Configure parameters using sliders
5. Click "Build Model"
6. Train and save

### **Option 2: Custom Architecture (Advanced)**

**Backend Integration:**
Create a new model architecture in `Backend/app/models/architectures/`:

```python
# Backend/app/models/architectures/my_custom_model.py

from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, LSTM, Dense, Dropout

def build_my_custom_model(
    input_shape: tuple,
    n_predictions: int,
    lstm_units: int = 128,
    dropout: float = 0.2
) -> Model:
    """
    My custom LSTM architecture with special sauce
    
    Args:
        input_shape: (sequence_length, num_features)
        n_predictions: Number of future steps to predict
        lstm_units: LSTM layer size
        dropout: Dropout rate
    
    Returns:
        Compiled Keras model
    """
    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
    
    # Your custom architecture here
    x = LSTM(lstm_units, return_sequences=True)(inputs)
    x = Dropout(dropout)(x)
    x = LSTM(lstm_units // 2)(x)
    x = Dropout(dropout)(x)
    outputs = Dense(n_predictions)(x)
    
    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
    
    return model
```

**Register in Model Catalog:**
```python
# Backend/app/models/model_catalog.py

MODEL_CATALOG = [
    {
        "id": "my_custom_lstm",
        "name": "My Custom LSTM",
        "category": "lstm",
        "description": "Custom LSTM with special sauce",
        "parameters": [
            {"name": "lstm_units", "type": "int", "default": 128, "min": 32, "max": 512},
            {"name": "dropout", "type": "float", "default": 0.2, "min": 0.0, "max": 0.5}
        ],
        "builder_function": "build_my_custom_model",
        "input_requirements": {
            "min_sequence_length": 30,
            "min_features": 5
        },
